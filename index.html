# Meet Sam
Sam does science in a lab, and is what many people might think of as a "traditional" scientist.

# Now meet Joy
Joy works in the same area as Sam, but writes computer code to do their work, a **non-traditional academic output**.

# It's all essential
Sam and Joy both do essential research work, but we'll be focusing on Joy, and some of the challenges they face

# Challenges for computational research

### Missing computational _tools_ for research, insufficient incentive to draw, retain, and reward _talent_, and insufficient _trust_ in computational work.

---
# Tools
- Much research is so niche the computational tools needed may not exist, _and yet..._
- Sometimes it's the opposite, and tools are fragmented across many software tools and standards.

![xkcd showing proliferation of standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

---
# Trust

A lot of tech has a **bad name** for a **good reason** - companies, governments, healthcare officials, and researchers don't always use people's data in trustworthy ways.

---
# Talent
- Code is not papers
- Good practice may not be directly appreciated (except by future you and other maintainers)

---
# Talent
- May not be shared, or may not be open in spirit
- Researchers may (justifiably) feel the need to hide the code aspects of their work in a grant application, or not realise they are doing (or should be doing) software engineering / data science

---
# Talent
##  Places where diversity tends to be bad:
- software engineering is bad,
- open source
- some research domains.

We're at the intersection of these places!

---
# Data for Science and Health

### Our goal: To fund the Tools, Talent, Trust that makes trustworthy data science a first-class citizen in the research ecosystem

---
# Wellcome's focus

 The Wellcome Trust's strategy focuses on three primary areas, as well as a broader "discovery research" umbrella:

- Global heating
- Mental health
- Infectious disease

# Open work we've (co-)funded so far

**afrimapr**

Open source components and training to ease the use of health data by analysts in Africa [github.com/afrimapr](https://github.com/afrimapr)

# Open work we've (co-)funded so far

**OpenSAFELY**

Open tool to make computational work across healthcare data secure and safe. [github.com/opensafely](https://github.com/opensafely/)

---
# Shining a spotlight on the **good**

Well-done software means focusing on maintainable code, but also on:

- Documentation (for users _and_ developers)
- Accessibility (in the sense of [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/), rather than [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/))
- Healthy and diverse community
- UX (User Experience)

---
# Interested / think there might be a good fit?
We're curating a blog to spotlight good practice in open source research.

Currently looking for:
- Software to share (in the form of a repo, docs, papers, blogs, podcasts, notebooks, useful tools, etc.)
- Guest editors to help curate collections of 2-4 tools

---
# Interested / think there might be a good fit?

If you have a project idea for a software tool that you think might fit into our funding interests, [please contact us](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/data-science-and-health-trustworthy-data-science)!
